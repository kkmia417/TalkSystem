CSV-driven dialogue tooling for Unity games. Talk System gives you branching dialogue, validation, preview playback, runtime extension points, and a visual graph editor while keeping dialogue data easy to edit in CSV or external tools.

## Why Use It

- Author dialogue in CSV, Google Sheets exports, JSON, or writer-friendly text imports.
- Validate duplicate IDs, broken links, unreachable rows, cycles, and malformed data before Play Mode.
- Preview and edit dialogue from Unity editor tools.
- Build production flows with choices, conditions, variables, events, save data, backlog/history, and custom views.
- Install through Unity Package Manager and import samples directly into a project.

## Installation

Open **Window > Package Manager > Add package from git URL**:

```text
https://github.com/kkmia417/TalkSystem.git
```

For production projects, pin a release tag or commit:

```text
https://github.com/kkmia417/TalkSystem.git#v0.2.0
https://github.com/kkmia417/TalkSystem.git#<commit-sha>
```

Minimum Unity version: `6000.0`. The package declares `com.unity.ugui@2.0.0`, which provides the UGUI and TextMeshPro assemblies used by the runtime UI. Live2D Cubism and Spine integrations are optional and stay behind scripting defines plus their external SDKs.

## Quick Start

1. Install the package from the Git URL.
2. Import the **Feature Tour** sample from Package Manager.
3. Open `FeatureTour.unity` and press Play.
4. Open `Tools/kkmia/Dialogue Graph Editor` to inspect the sample dialogue as nodes.
5. Run `Tools/kkmia/Dialogue Validator` before shipping dialogue changes.

Start dialogue from code:

```csharp
using kkmia.TalkSystem;

DialogueManager.Instance.StartDialogue(1);
DialogueManager.Instance.StartDialogueForState("QuestStart");
```

## CSV Format

Required columns:

```csv
Id,Speaker,Text,NextId,EmotionKey,TriggerKey,ConditionKey
```

Optional production columns:

```csv
EventKey,Choices,AutoNextSeconds
```

Example:

```csv
Id,Speaker,Text,NextId,EmotionKey,TriggerKey,ConditionKey,EventKey,Choices,AutoNextSeconds
1,Guide,"Hello, {playerName}. Choose a path.",-1,happy,QuestStart,,quest_started,"Left->2?can_go_left|Right->3",
```

Choices use `Label->NextId` entries separated by `|`. Add `?conditionKey` to hide a choice unless your `IDialogueConditionEvaluator` returns true.

## Runtime Extension Points

- `IDialogueConditionEvaluator`: evaluates `ConditionKey`
- `IDialogueVariableResolver`: resolves placeholders such as `{playerName}`
- `IDialogueTextResolver`: supports localization keys or external text databases
- `IDialogueEventDispatcher`: reacts to `EventKey`
- `IDialogueView`: swaps UGUI for custom UI Toolkit, Timeline, or in-game terminal views
- `DialogueSaveData`: integrates current dialogue state with your save system

## Editor Tools

Open from the Unity menu:

- `Tools/kkmia/Dialogue Graph Editor`
- `Tools/kkmia/Dialogue CSV Editor`
- `Tools/kkmia/Dialogue Validator`
- `Tools/kkmia/Dialogue Preview`
- `Tools/kkmia/Dialogue Import Export`
